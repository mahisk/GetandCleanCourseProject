# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
	1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Repository file details
	1. README.md -- containes details on executing the scripts
	2. CodeBook.md -- containes details on data files
	3. run_analysis.R -- containes script for Getting and Cleaning Data
	4. tidydata.txt -- output of the clean data for further analysis 

## Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:

	1. Download the zip file https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
	2. Unzip the file and copy UCI HAR Dataset folder.
	3. Paste the UCI HAR Dataset folder in working directory where we have run_analysis.R
	4. source the file run_analysis.R
	5. Run the Script run_analysis
	6. Output file tidydata.txt will be generated in the current working folder.
